# portfolio-project

Hi there. This is an existing private project that has been cloned, made public, and reduced somewhat to become a portfolio project of sorts. It won't be runnable but hopefully the reader can get a feel for the code style etc.

It's a monorepo setup and each package should show different area of concern. It's nearly all typescript, although some transpilation folders may exist still

Probably good place to start would be the `partridge-importer` package - that's the most "complex" i suppose.
