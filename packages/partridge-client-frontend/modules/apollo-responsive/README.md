# Apollo-Responsive

This is just my attempt to create a [resolver](http://bit.ly/2s42IcC)
which will maintain a local state account of the responsive media type
of the site. 
 - Inspired by [redux-responsive](http://bit.ly/2s5dQpD)
 - Uses the JS [http://bit.ly/2s4tt0L](mediaMatch) standards to derive responsive capabilities. [See here also](http://bit.ly/2s4ljWd)
 - Accepts a parameterised media match value ([from UA][https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js]) in order to allow setting Server Side

Keeping everything within this directory to possibly allow for opensourcing later
